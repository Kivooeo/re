rusted http file server\

# how to use this thing for your own\

first of all we need say thanks this cool tcp tunned written in rust https://github.com/ekzhang/bore\
after this we have to install this cool thing on your pc \
(i hope you've installed rust itself already if not please visit rustup.rs)\
so we have to run this two commands to install and run bore\

`cargo install bore-cli`\
and then run\
`bore local 8000 --to bore.pub --port 8000`\
\

after this clone my giga project that in about 8 hours\
`git clone https://github.com/Kivooeo/re`\
and then go to the dictionary you've just cloned \
`cd re`\
and then run it \
`cargo run`\
\
but please before running code make sure you changed the pathes in soruce code\
because for me is user name is Tea\
and OS is windiows\
so i have path like this\
`C:/Users/Tea/.shared`\
and you have to change it to your own inlucding folder (you have to create it before)\
